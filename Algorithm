Algorithm
STEP 1: START
STEP 2: Ask the user for a number and store it in num, also store a copy of the original number in num1
STEP 3: In a while loop, with condition num!=0
	write the following code for reversing the number num
	rem=num%10
	rev=rev*10+rem
	num=num/10
STEP 4: Print the original number and the reversed number
STEP 5: Compare if reversed number and original number are equal
	if true, print the number is a palindrome
	if false, print the number is not a palindrome
STEP 6: STOP
